## File hash 

- SHA256(act2.img) = e8eb702c1b2fc938039723cf87628bc669b8e23de16eaa6aefe64cd7e22750c1




-- Methodology 

Something like this would be good to have here:

The software and shell tools used in the investigation are as follows: 
sha256sum – displays the SHA256 hash of a file. 
e2undel / scalpel – recovers deleted files. 
chkrootkit - checks the system for known rootkits. 
cd – changes and navigates through directories. 
less – displays contents of a text file. 
grep - searches a file for matching strings. 
stat – displays detailed information relating to a file or file system.
